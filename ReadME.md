### Face detection with HaarCascade and MTCNN.

How to use:
1. Download the this repositorie and haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file 
2. Execute python file:
	 image_facedetect.py --> detect face from image file using OpenCV HaarCascade
	 video_facedetect.py --> detect face from video file using OpenCVHaarCascade
	 mtcnn_facedetect_image.py-->detect face with Facenets MTCNN
